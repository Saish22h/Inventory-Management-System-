# Inventory-Management-System-
To create an inventory management system using python json file
I have used a single file to to create records, print the bill, update the inventory and to create a sales report.
The records file contains over 30 values with attributes such as product name,price,quantity,manufacturing date and type of product.
The user has to enter the number of products required.Then the user has to enter the product id and the required quantity.
the program checks of the inventory has the required quantity and if insufficient number is available then it asks the user if them wants available quantity. 
The program creates a bill of the purchased products and applied the discount based on the following criteria: If the amount exceeds Rs 1000 then flat 20% discount. If amount is less, then 30% discount upto Rs 100.
The program creates a sales file which includes the transaction id as key and customer name ,phone number,a list of the product ids bought by the customer and a list of the quantity of each product bought,the gross total and the net total amount paid by the customer.
The program also has the feature to add new product to the inventory as well as update the quantity of existing product.
